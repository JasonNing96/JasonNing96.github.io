This paper presents EdgePrompt, a distributed key-value inference framework designed for large language models in 6G networks. The framework addresses the challenges of deploying LLMs in next-generation wireless networks through efficient distributed KV-Cache management, implementing KV routing and consistency management, sharding and streaming strategies to reduce end-to-end latency and improve throughput in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.
