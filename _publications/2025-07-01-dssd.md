This paper introduces DSSD, a novel distributed speculative decoding framework that enables efficient deployment and collaborative inference of large language models on edge devices. The approach combines speculative decoding with edge-cloud collaboration, innovatively designing network uplink/downlink logic to achieve at least 2X model acceleration. Funded by Huawei to attend the 42nd ICML Machine Learning Conference.
