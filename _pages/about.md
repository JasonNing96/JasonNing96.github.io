*"Imagination is more important than knowledge, knowledge is limited, imagination encircles the world."*

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Jiahong Ning (宁嘉鸿), currently pursuing a Joint-Ph.D program at A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Singapore, working under the supervision of Prof. Sumei Sun (Fellow of The Academy of Engineering, Singapore). I am also a Ph.D candidate in Traffic Control and Transport Engineering at Dalian Maritime University, China, supervised by Prof. Tingting Yang.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on **MEC (Mobile Edge Computing)** and **LLM (Large Language Model) inference acceleration**, with expertise in:

- **KV-Cache Memory Consistency Management & Speculative Decoding**: Designing efficient caching strategies and acceleration mechanisms for large language models
- **Edge-Cloud Collaborative Offloading & Resource Scheduling**: Optimizing resource allocation and system performance under constrained conditions  
- **6G Communication Networks**: Developing generative AI resource scheduling and deployment optimization for next-generation wireless networks
- **Distributed Learning Systems**: Reinforcement learning, federated learning, and integrated communication-computation architectures

I bridge the gap between **market demands and academic research**, with proven experience in **team leadership and project management**. I have led teams in applying for and advancing National Key R&D Programs, supporting the complete project lifecycle from **initiation → implementation → completion**.
