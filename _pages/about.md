*"Imagination is more important than knowledge, knowledge is limited, imagination encircles the world."*

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Jiahong Ning, currently pursuing a Joint-Ph.D in Computer Science and Communication Technology at A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore. My research spans the exciting intersection of edge computing, generative AI, and distributed systems.

## Research Interest

Edge distributed computing, Internet of Things, Generative AI, Speculative decoding. I focus on accelerating large-model inference in edge and IoT environments using speculative sampling, wireless task offloading, and distributed learning. My work aims to efficiently deploy pre-trained models for AGI applications under resource constraints.

## Recent News

* **May 2025**: Presenting "EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G Networks" at IEEE INFOCOM 2025, London
* **2025**: Three papers accepted at top-tier venues: ICML 2025, INFOCOM 2025, and IEEE ChinaCom 2025
* **May 2024**: Started Joint-Ph.D program at A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore

## Research Highlights

I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI models and practical deployment scenarios. My current research focuses on:

- **Edge-Cloud Collaborative Intelligence**: Developing efficient model offloading strategies for resource-constrained devices
- **Speculative Decoding for LLMs**: Accelerating large language model inference through distributed speculative sampling
- **6G Network Integration**: Designing AI-native frameworks for next-generation wireless networks
- **Distributed Learning Systems**: Creating robust algorithms for federated and collaborative learning
